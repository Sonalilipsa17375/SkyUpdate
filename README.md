**Sky Update: A React Weather App with 3D Background**

This project is a React weather application named "Sky Update" that retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it alongside a visually appealing 3D particle background powered by the particle.js library.

**Features:**

- Leverages the OpenWeatherMap API for accurate weather information.
- User-friendly interface with search bar for location lookup.
- Displays current temperature, minimum and maximum temperatures, humidity, and pressure.
- Engaging 3D particle background animation (using particle.js).
- Clean and modular React component structure.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can verify these by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
   - A basic understanding of React.js concepts is recommended.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sky-update.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command will download and install all the necessary libraries required for the application to function properly.

4. **Obtain an OpenWeatherMap API Key:**
   - Create a free account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
   - Navigate to your API keys page and generate a new API key.
   - You'll need this key to fetch weather data in the application.

5. **Configure the API Key:**
   - Open the `src/components/Temp.js` file.
   - Find the line `appid=YOUR_API_KEY` and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

6. **Run the Application:**
   - In your terminal, within the project directory, execute:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the development server and launch the application in your default web browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000/`.

**Usage:**

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. By default, the application displays the weather for "Mumbai."
3. To search for weather information in a different location, simply enter the city name in the search bar at the top and press Enter.
4. The application retrieves current temperature, minimum and maximum temperatures, humidity, and pressure for your entered location.

**Project Structure:**

- `src/`: Contains the application's source code:
  - `App.js`: The main application entry point.
  - `components/`: Houses reusable React components:
    - `Temp.js`: Manages weather data fetching, rendering, and user interaction.
    - `particles.js`: (Optional) Integrates the particle.js library for the 3D background animation (implementation not included).
- `package.json`: Manages project dependencies and scripts.

**Customization:**

- You can enhance the UI appearance by customizing styles in `./src/stylesheets/style.css` (not included in this example).
- Explore advanced particle.js configuration options to tailor the 3D background animation (refer to particle.js documentation for details).

**Further Development:**

- Implement error handling for cases where weather data cannot be retrieved.
- Add support for additional weather data points (e.g., wind speed, weather description).
- Consider adding a unit conversion feature (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).
- Explore ways to improve user experience, such as displaying weather icons based on weather conditions.
